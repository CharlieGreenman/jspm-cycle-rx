[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

lightweight React.js boilerplate with JSPM and hot reloading, npm scripts available:
```
npm start
npm build
npm test
```

## Styles
Make your own style pipeline, this boilerplate doesn't offer one. Me personally, I am fine with inline styles inside my react components most of the time, but that is just me.

## Includes
- material icons
- githooks for commit trigerring tests and style check
- react-router
